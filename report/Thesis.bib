	abstract = {Power has become the primary design constraint for chip designers today. While Moore's law continues to provide additional transistors, power budgets have begun to prohibit those devices from actually being used. To reduce energy consumption, voltage scaling techniques have proved a popular technique with subthreshold design representing the endpoint of voltage scaling. Although it is extremely energy efficient, subthreshold design has been relegated to niche markets due to its major performance penalties. This paper defines and explores near-threshold computing ({NTC}), a design space where the supply voltage is approximately equal to the threshold voltage of the transistors. This region retains much of the energy savings of subthreshold operation with more favorable performance and variability characteristics. This makes it applicable to a broad range of power-constrained computing segments from sensors to high performance servers. This paper explores the barriers to the widespread adoption of {NTC} and describes current work aimed at overcoming these obstacles.},

	abstract = {Cooling of datacenters is estimated to have an annual electricity cost of 1.4 billion dollars in the United States and 3.6 billion dollars worldwide. Currently, refrigerated air is the most widely used means of cooling datacenter’s servers, which typically represents 40–45\% of the total energy consumed in a datacenter. Based on the above issues, thermal designers of datacenters and server manufacturers now seem to agree that there is an immediate need to improve the server cooling process. The goal of the present study is to propose and simulate the performance of a novel hybrid two-phase cooling cycle with micro-evaporator elements (multi-microchannel evaporators) for direct cooling of the chips and auxiliary electronics on blade server boards (savings in energy consumption of over 60\% are expected). Different working fluids were considered, namely water, {HFC}134a and a new, more environmentally friendly, refrigerant {HFO}1234ze. The results so far demonstrated that the pumping power consumption is on the order of 5 times higher for the water-cooled cycle. Additionally, a case study considering the hybrid cooling cycle applied on a datacenter and exploring the application of energy recovered in the condenser on a feedwater heater of a coal power plant was also investigated (modern datacenters require the dissipation of 5–15 {MW} of heat). Aspects such as minimization of energy consumption and {CO}2 footprint and maximization of energy recovery (exergetic efficiency) and power plant efficiency are investigated.},

	abstract = {Data centres consist of data halls, or buildings, containing rows of {IT} server racks, which are used to store, process and transmit information from connected computer networks. There are estimated to be more than 2 million server racks in the {UK}. Data centres are large energy users, being currently responsible for at least 1.5\% of the electricity demand for the whole of the {UK} and with increased internet use this is projected to grow by up to 20\% per year up to 2020. Electricity is used both to power the {IT} servers and for the cooling equipment, such as air conditioning systems, which are used to remove the heat generated by the {IT} servers. This heat is normally discharged to the ambient air; however, if the heat could be recovered and reused, it would represent a significant heat resource. This paper describes the range of approaches available for the cooling of {IT} servers and their potential for waste heat recovery and reuse. One waste heat recovery application that has been recently proposed, for example by the {UK}'s Department of Energy and Climate Change ({DECC}), is as a heat source for district heating networks. The use of heat pumps to boost the temperature of the waste heat rejected by data centres, in order to meet the heat input requirements for heat networks is explored in this paper, and the potential energy, carbon and cost savings available are presented. The matching of potential data centre waste heat sources to the heat requirements for a number of London districts is also reported.},

Heterogeneous datacenters deploy clusters of servers with different hardware configurations, each offering its own performance and power characteristics. We observe that heterogeneous datacenters offer a unique opportunity to reduce cooling power through appropriate planning. In this paper we formulate the problem of rack layout for planning of heterogeneous datacenters, where the goal is to identify the best locations of the server racks with different hardware capabilities to improve the supply temperatures of the {CRAC} units and the total cooling power. We provide optimal solutions that take into account the impact of varying utilizations of datacenters and job scheduling methods. Using state-of-the-art thermal modeling tools, we prove that our methods lead to datacenter layouts with significant improvements in cooling power reduction, between 15.5\%-38.5\% based on the datacenter utilizations and an average of 28.3\% without any negative side effects.},

	abstract = {Pervasive use of cloud computing and the resulting rise in the number of datacenters and hosting centers (that provide platform or software services to clients who do not have the means to set up and operate their own computing facilities) have brought forth many concerns, including the electrical energy cost, peak power dissipation, cooling, and carbon emission. With power consumption becoming an increasingly important issue for the operation and maintenance of the hosting centers, corporate and business owners are becoming increasingly concerned. Furthermore, provisioning resources in a cost-optimal manner so as to meet different performance criteria, such as throughput or response time, has become a critical challenge. The goal of this paper is to provide an introduction to resource provisioning and power or thermal management problems in datacenters, and to review strategies that maximize the datacenter energy efficiency subject to peak or total power consumption and thermal constraints, while meeting stipulated service level agreements in terms of task throughput and/or response time.},

	abstract = {The direct electricity used by data centers has become an important issue in recent years as demands for new Internet services (such as search, music downloads, video-on-demand, social networking, and telephony) have become more widespread. This study estimates historical electricity used by data centers worldwide and regionally on the basis of more detailed data than were available for previous assessments, including electricity used by servers, data center communications, and storage equipment. Aggregate electricity use for data centers doubled worldwide from 2000 to 2005. Three quarters of this growth was the result of growth in the number of the least expensive (volume) servers. Data center communications and storage equipment each contributed about 10\% of the growth. Total electricity use grew at an average annual rate of 16.7\% per year, with the Asia Pacific region (without Japan) being the only major world region with growth significantly exceeding that average. Direct electricity used by information technology equipment in data centers represented about 0.5\% of total world electricity consumption in 2005. When electricity for cooling and power distribution is included, that figure is about 1\%. Worldwide data center power demand in 2005 was equivalent (in capacity terms) to about seventeen 1000 {MW} power plants.},
